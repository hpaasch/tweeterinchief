      <p>This is a nonpartisan constantly updating list of the Top 20 Most Popular tweets from President-elect Donald Trump.
      This list counts tweets made on or after Jan. 10, 2017. The "most
      popular" calculation is a simple one, adding together "retweets" and "likes." My own
      theory is that "likes" most often show support, while "retweets" simply
      represent sharing the tweet with others and cannot be interpreted as approval or
      disapproval.
      </p>
      <p>If you have a Twitter account, you can retweet or like the ones shown here.</p>
      <p>The list updates each time you return, so check back often!</p>
